#### Q: 
Tell us about one thing you are proud of in your career. It could be a difficult technical problem you had to solve in your work or a personal project. There is no need to go into details; a short paragraph explaining the problem and why you are proud of it would be fine. 

#### A:
During my graduate program at Capitalflow, I was asked to create a widget that allowed users to start the analysis process of uploaded bank statements and return the related analysis to credit underwriting. I am most proud of this project since I managed to complete it within the deadline bar it being my first project on the team. This gave me great confidence going forward knowing I can handle the work and meet my deadlines. The result of this project provided credit underwriting with operational efficiencies and proved to be a valuable tool for the business. I'm also proud of this fact.
